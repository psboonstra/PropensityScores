- `PropensityScores.R` is all of the R code I used to create the presentation. 
It is the result of running `knitr::purl("PropensityScores.Rmd")`, where 
`PropensityScores.Rmd` is a markdown file (that I have not shared) that I wrote

- The data are `rhc_exercise.dta`, which I have obtained from here:

https://www.ofcaus.org/literature/tutorial-formulating-causal-questions-and-principled-statistical-answers

and have also made a copy formatted as `csv`
